        <h1>Taxis</h1>
        <p>Taxis are a convenient and relatively affordable way to get around Rome. They are easily recognizable by their white color and "TAXI" sign on the roof. Here is some general information on taxis in Rome:<br>

            <br>Taxi stands: Taxis can be found at designated taxi stands throughout the city, which are marked by a "TAXI" sign. They can also be hailed on the street, although this is less common.<br>
            
            <br>Fares: Taxis in Rome are regulated by the city, and fares are calculated based on distance and time. There is a base fee for entering the taxi, and then a per-kilometer rate that increases at night and on weekends. There may also be additional fees for luggage, airport transfers, and other special circumstances.<br>
            
            <br>Payment: Taxis in Rome generally accept both cash and credit card payments. However, it is always a good idea to confirm with the driver before starting the ride.<br>
            
            <br>Taxi apps: There are several taxi apps available in Rome, such as MyTaxi and Uber, which allow users to hail and pay for taxis using their smartphones. These apps can be especially useful for getting a taxi during peak hours or in areas with few taxi stands.<br>
            
            <br>Safety: Taxis in Rome are generally safe and reliable. However, it is always a good idea to use licensed taxis and to be cautious when taking a taxi alone at night.
            
            <br>Tips: Tipping is not mandatory in Italy, but it is common to round up the fare or add a small tip for good service.
